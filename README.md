## 🦸‍♂️ About Me

I’m a **third-year Software Engineering student** with **two years of professional experience** in **full-stack development, databases, and DevOps**.  
I’m passionate about creating **modern, efficient, and scalable digital solutions** — from robust backend architectures to sleek, responsive frontends.

I specialize in designing and building **end-to-end systems** that combine powerful server-side logic, intuitive user interfaces, and **cloud-based deployment pipelines**.  

Currently, I’m involved in a **TEKNOFEST project** and leading the development of a **complete website and internal management applications** for a major company — handling operations, finances, and installation workflows.  

In my spare time, I contribute to **community and open-source projects**, exploring new technologies and sharing knowledge with other developers.
